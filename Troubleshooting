The main issues with not getting the desired output on the tubes is outlines below.


1. The DMX channel routing is not aligned between the Advatek 16 mk11 and the control software. 
  This issue can be a pain in the ass. To figure this out connect to the Advatek 16 mk11 using the Advatek assistant app and click on LEDÂ´s
Then click advanced output configuration. 

Now you will see how each of the outputs on the Advatek 16 mk11 has been set up in terms of its DMX universe. 

The pipes have 59 Pixels in them. Each with 3 Leds in each pixel. RGB. That is 177 DMX channels needed for each tube.

The Advatek 16 mk11 can ouput up to 1020 pixels on each output. 

Therefore a common problem is that if the outputs are setup using the Automatic sequential channels button down the bottom. 

Then the first tube will work perfectly because it just goes from 1-177 on output 1. But then on output 2 you are still on DMX universe 1 but its channel 178-354   

This can be an issue especially in MADMAPPER because often it is expecting that each light has its own channel. 

So the best way to do it is change the formatiing so that each output has its own channel. 1-16 respectively. And each channel starts at 1 and goes to 177. 

Then you just have to match this with how the fixtures are set up in MADMAPPER.

# GoodPipes
GOODPIPES is cost effective portable DIY LED tube lighting system. 
Designed and built using materials sourced in Reykjavik, Iceland. 

The system consists of 11 x 1m LED tube lights and a control box. 

The Tubes are made of 50mm diameter poly pipe bought from Johan Rönning available in 4m lengths. 

The connectors are 4 pin áviation plugs´bought from Amazon.

The cables are 4 pin wire bought from Johan Rönning with the connectors soldered on. 
 
The controller box is an Advatek 16mkII. You connect to the controller wirelessly using the router built into the control box. Or you can connect directly through a network cable to the Advatek itself. Bypassing the router. For events over 50 people i would reccomend a wired connection. 

The Advatek controller programmer can be found here if settings need to be changed on the controller. https://www.advateklights.com/downloads/advatek-assistant

The easiest control app to use the lights is called LEDLAB and is available on IOS, Ipad and M1 mac´s. https://apps.apple.com/us/app/l-e-d-lab/id832042156 
The app is free but the display turns off after 15 minutes. To get away with the features needed for a show you will need to purchase at least the Authoring and LED display upgrades. Approx $50USD.
